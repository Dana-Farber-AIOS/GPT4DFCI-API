# GPT4DFCI API üîå

**Welcome to the code repository for GPT4DFCI API, the API client of [GPT4DFCI](https://github.com/Dana-Farber-AIOS/GPT4DFCI), which a allows you to leverage GPT4DFCI programmatically in your application.**

*‚ÑπÔ∏è GPT4DFCI is a private and secure generative AI tool, based on GPT-4 and deployed for non-clinical use at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. See all details about it in its [code repository](https://github.com/Dana-Farber-AIOS/GPT4DFCI).*

This repository is organized in the following sections:

* Prerequisites
* Run the GPT4DFCI API demo
* License
* Contact

## ‚öôÔ∏è  Prerequisites

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python used by a number of the demos.

If you are already familiar with Poetry, or are comfortable setting up your own environment with other tools, you can probably skip this.

### Installing Poetry
https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation

#### For macOS this would be the suggested way:

- Install brew: 

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

- Install poetry using: 
```
brew install poetry
```

### Installing GPT4DFCI API dependencies

After installing Poetry, navigate to the directory you are interested in and run:

```
poetry install --no-root
```

This should create a virtual environment with the dependencies specified in `pyproject.toml` installed.


To activate the virtual environment, run:

```
poetry shell
```

or, alternatively, if you don't want to use Poetry's [sub-shell](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#activating-the-virtual-environment) pattern, you can run:
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```


## üü¢  Run the GPT4DFCI API demo

### Set up environment variables
In a file called `.env`, fill in the following values:

```
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://...
AZURE_OPENAI_ENTRA_SCOPE=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
```

`AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` should be the GPT4DFCI API endpoint, without the `/openai` suffix.

`AZURE_OPENAI_ENTRA_SCOPE` should be the scope required for the bearer token, the UUID `client_id`.

### Authenticate via Azure CLI
Prerequisites: [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/)

For macOS this would be

```
brew install azure-cli
```

Then, make sure you are logged in via the Azure CLI to an account that has been granted access to the GPT4DFCI API.

```
az login
```

Close the window after logging in and get back to the shell.


### VPN

```
Turn on the VPN or make sure you are running from an on-prem resource.
```

### Run the demo
```
export $(cat .env | xargs) && python demo.py
```

### Shutting down

When finished working, shut the current virtual environment with

```
deactivate
```

### Resuming work

When you are read to resume working on this, come back to this folder and resume working with

```
source .venv/bin/activate
export $(cat .env | xargs) && python demo.py
```
